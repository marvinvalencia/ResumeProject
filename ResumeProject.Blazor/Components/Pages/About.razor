                I am a Software Developer with 11 years of experience. My main tech stacks are primarily .NET focused. 
                I'm proficient in C#, SQL Server and .NET Technologies. I have always been a problem solver. 
                I was usually a DEV Support and was on call frequently in which I gained a lot of experience with client issues. 
                Resolved numerous bugs and implemented various workarounds, providing thorough investigations and detailed analyses for each issue. 
                I worked previously with legacy codes but I'm a fast learner and can definitely adapt to new technologies as well.
